MarsCycle
Autonomous Inorganic Waste Recycling System for Mars

Integration site with Robin’s features and their interactions with the colony, containers and production lines.

Context — The NASA Space Challenge

During a hypothetical 3-year mission to Mars and back, a crew of eight astronauts would generate 12,600 kg of inorganic waste — including packaging, textiles, and structural materials.
Transporting additional resources from Earth or sending waste back is expensive and inefficient.
Our mission is to design a sustainable, autonomous system that can manage, reuse, and recycle inorganic waste directly on Mars, turning “trash” into valuable resources.

Problem
Current scenario

Astronauts generate waste daily (packaging, equipment maintenance, food containers). Without recycling systems, this waste accumulates and becomes unusable mass.

Root cause

There is no intelligent, automated system capable of classifying, prioritizing, and transforming waste into useful resources in real time.

Measurable impact

12,600 kg of material wasted per mission

Millions of USD lost in unused resources

90% of waste that could be recycled remains discarded

Increased dependency on Earth shipments

How might we…

“How might we create an intelligent ecosystem that identifies, collects, and transforms waste into prioritized resources in real-time, ensuring a complete circular economy on Mars?”

Solution: MarsCycle

An autonomous recycling ecosystem integrated with robotic fleets and AI to manage inorganic waste on Mars.

Core Layers
Layer 1 — Robin Fleet (Autonomous Collection)
Robot Type	Function	Quantity
